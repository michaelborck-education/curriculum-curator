# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Curriculum Curator project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help us understand why certain decisions were made and provide a history of the project's evolution.

## ADR Index

### Guiding Principles

| ADR | Title | Status |
|-----|-------|--------|
| [0018](0018-workflow-flexibility-philosophy.md) | **Workflow Flexibility Philosophy** | **Accepted** |
| [0020](0020-ai-optional-user-empowerment.md) | **AI-Optional User Empowerment** | **Accepted** |

> *"Assist any workflow, don't enforce"* - This principle informs all other architectural decisions.
> 
> *"AI assists, never gates"* - Every task achievable with AI must be equally achievable without it.

### Current Stack (Active Decisions)

| ADR | Title | Status |

### User Experience
- [ADR-0004: Teaching Philosophy System](0004-teaching-philosophy-system.md) - Personalization framework
- [ADR-0018: Workflow Flexibility](0018-workflow-flexibility-philosophy.md) - Assist, don't enforce
- [ADR-0020: AI-Optional User Empowerment](0020-ai-optional-user-empowerment.md) - AI assists, never gates

### Authentication & Security
- [ADR-0007: Simple Authentication for Internal Network](0007-simple-authentication-internal-network.md) - Basic auth approach
- [ADR-0008: Email Verification with Cross-Device Support](0008-email-verification-cross-device.md) - Dual-method verification
- [ADR-0009: Self-Service Password Reset](0009-self-service-password-reset.md) - Email-based password recovery
- [ADR-0010: Security Hardening](0010-security-hardening.md) - Comprehensive security measures
- [ADR-0011: Deployment Best Practices](0011-deployment-best-practices.md) - Production deployment guidelines

### Superseded Decisions (Historical)

These ADRs document previous architectural directions that have since been replaced:

| ADR | Title | Superseded By |
|-----|-------|---------------|
| [0002](0002-fasthtml-web-framework.md) | FastHTML Web Framework | ADR-0016 |
| [0006](0006-pure-fasthtml-no-javascript.md) | Pure FastHTML Without JavaScript | ADR-0016 |
| [0012](0012-framework-migration-fasthtml-to-nicegui.md) | Framework Migration to NiceGUI | ADR-0016 |

**Evolution Summary**: The project started with FastHTML (server-rendered Python), planned a migration to NiceGUI (never implemented), and ultimately adopted React + TypeScript frontend with FastAPI backend for the production stack.

## ADR Status

- **Accepted**: The decision is accepted and implemented
- **Proposed**: The decision is under consideration
- **Deprecated**: The decision has been superseded by another ADR
- **Superseded**: The decision has been replaced (links to replacement)

## Creating New ADRs

Use the [template.md](template.md) to create new ADRs. Number them sequentially and use descriptive titles.

## Best Practices

1. **Immutability**: Once accepted, ADRs should not be edited except for:
   - Minor typo fixes
   - Adding links to related ADRs
   - Updating status when superseded

2. **Cross-References**: Link related ADRs to show how decisions build on each other

3. **Context is Key**: Explain WHY the decision was made, not just what was decided

4. **Consider Alternatives**: Document what other options were considered and why they were rejected
